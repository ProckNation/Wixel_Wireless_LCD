Wixel_Wireless_LCD
==================

Combining a Adafruit I2C LCD Backpack with two Wixels to make it a wirelessly controlled LCD with extra IO to allow for buttons and status LEDs.

For more info go to http://thewiki.procknation.com/index.php?title=Wixel_Wireless_LCD.  I will post on this readme when I make changes to the wiki site.

But until the project hardware and software is finished the wiki will not be very useful.

If you have any specific questions you can not find an answer, you can email me.
